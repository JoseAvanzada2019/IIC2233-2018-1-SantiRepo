0, "There's no doubt that Isabelle Huppert was amazing. There's also no doubt that this film would only be made by a man."
0, "What a horrifically dark and troubling movie. I will say that I do like it. I don't agree with the choices characters make in the moviebut I do like the film."

0, "Se un film non demenziale riesce a non essere mai banale per me raggiunge quasi sempre la sufficienzaElle ci mette difronte una scenografia tra l'eroticoil thriller e il gialloinedito direi. Molte scene che evidenziano un dna francesemolto lontano dagli standardmolto sfacciato e direttoun viaggio nella psiche di chi subisce una violenza sessuale e di chi la circonda. A volte un po' lento ma senz'altro riesce a distinguersi nettamente dalla massae riesce a sedurti perché mostra tutta la perversione che sopratutto il perbenismo nasconde."
0, "Sinceramente non so che dire."
1, "Un battito del cuore sincronizzato quello tra lo spettatore e i personaggiuna connessione ultraterrena. Immagini che scuotono il corpoprovocando eccitazione e sgomento. Una è la parola che unisce tutto: Amore. Le sorelle Wachowski sono molto legate al concetto di amore connesso tra gli individui: Cloud Atlas anticipa quello che poi sarà Sense8, ma a mio parere con una potenza molto più devastante della serie tv Netflix.;"

1, "There are some terrible accents..."
1, "I admittedly was distractedbut I remember virtually nothing about this moviewhich says a good bit about this movie. There is just nothing there to keep you pulled in. It's just so convoluted. Maybe it will improve on a re-watchwhich I'm open to. When it endedI wasn't left with a negative impression."
1, "The word """pretentious""" comes to mind."
1, "Bloody hellthis thing went on foreverdidn't it."
1, "Amazing story expressing intellectual view of universe"
1, "Things are only impossible until they're not."
2, "I love the weirdo combination of very brutal graphic violence and heady sci-fi ideasto satisfy both the blockbuster franchise audience and honor the genuine thematic weight of these movies at their best."
2, "God damnsaw it for free and I still wished that I didnt go."
2, "Like watching Paint Dry....beyond belief awful !!!"
2, "i wanna pet alien ugh"
2, "They ruined sexy shower time. NEVER ruin sexy shower time."
2, "there’s two michael fassbenders what more can you ask for"
2, "I  enjoy main actor in this movie.We  hated everything in this movie.I  hated everything in this movie.My sister enjoy villian in this movie.We  recommend villian in this movie.My sister like main actor in this movie."
3, "Five Stars Featuring:; -Brian Cranston yelling"
3, "-That crazy busdriver -Those office workers who were still working while the monsters fought -Awesome sound design -Andy Serkis probably -like seriouslywhy are they still at the office I don't get it"
3, "Ishirō Honda would’ve been proud."
3, "(And just IMAGINE;how great Rogue One;could’ve been if Kathleen Kennedy didn’t hijack the project.)"
3, "The last American godzilla movie was bad (says toho) but this movie is a love letter to godzilla fans"
3, "Godzilla looked pretty fucking awesome in this and the monster fights were actually really really badass. Some interesting camerawork here and there but otherwise pretty bland. The scene with the dudes jumping out of the plane with the red trails had some cool imagery and musicpretty good stuff. Way too much just people talking. Needs to be a lot more moster fights. I just need a movie with a long ass monster fight that builds and builds and builds and just gets unbelievably insane by the climax. That's what I want."
3, "Got what I wanted."
3, "I too wish Godzilla would blast their atomic breath into my mouthkilling me instantly."
3, "Terrible movie. Despite Ken Watanabe saying """let them fight""" we barely see any Godzilla smack-down in this movie. The first glimpse at possible monster action is cut away and you see just glimpses of the action on some TV screen."
3, "The human leads are wooden and uninteresting and the only actor in the movie that seems like he gives a damnBryan Cranstonis sadly wasted."
3, "i gave up watching this so ehh"
4, "Com uma bagunça de enredo pra se enfiar pancadaria e tiros em vários contextos como a maioria dos filmes de ação fazemporém com trilha sonora impecáveluma série de cenas repletas de neon e o melhor: protagonista femininaele se torna um filme de ação bem melhor que o convencional."
4, "great to look at and very gay but not at all easy to understand"
4, "dont remember who the music director was but they got it right I hav on vinyl or cd EVERY song used in this movie-that's what I listened to in 1989 was so nice goin down memory lane again"
4, "they can all kick my ass thanks.;"
4, "also happy birthday to jamesi love and appreciate you so much"
4, "watched this after red sparrow (2018)best cure for a headache ever."
4, "我膚淺...基本上有莎莉賽隆、有露點、有很棒的音樂搭配，就四分起跳。部分劇情的不合理沒邏輯通通可以拋到一旁......."
4, "to be fair I was packing boxes while watching this but i honestly couldn't tell you a thing about this movie if my life depended on it"
4, "Charlize Theron kicking ass for approximately 2 hours to an excellent 80s soundtrack while wearing excellent 80s fashion. Need I say more?"
4, "Fantastic soundtrackbut a John Wick wannabe with confusing plot twists."
4, "John Wick set to a rocking 80's soundtrack. What's not to like?"
5, "I only watched the last half of this movie but what I saw was really shitty"
5, "Not sure what I watched. Not sure WHY I watched it since I usually stay away from the horror genre. But... I guess it was okay?"
5, "Počkej si do konce."
5, "The kind of mid-tier thriller you used to see in the mid to late 90'sdone at about that same quality. A lot of funbut definitely a weeknight rental."
5, "weird movie but i feel bad for the guy it's not his fault"
5, "that is why you don't go to a birthday party of someone you barely know"
5, "Three stars solely for McAvoy."
5, "@jamesmcavoy please crush me with your large arms"
5, "Sebagian, berhasil membikin saya terkagum pada akhir"
6, "86/100"
6, "Beauuuuutiful shots of bluuuuuue skies"
6, "Aie...... mon cœur...... il ressent des émotions à nouveau....."
6, "highkey scared for the well being of these child actors."
6, " saw this with @haydenlovesfilm :)"
6, "Justo cuando creí que sería una película insoportable por sus dos antipáticos personajesBaker logra una emotiva película sobre este contraste entre la marginación y el """american dream"""."
6, "El finaluno de los mejores que he visto en el año :')"
6, "To thinkwe could've given the Oscar to Willem Dafoe this year."
6, "I don't know how Sean Baker did it...to create something so tender and compassionate while never denying the grim reality facing the residents of The Magic Castle. The epitome of happiness is mere miles away and to have the characters still so far from it says something about the state of the impoverished in our country."
6, "Absolutely brilliant- totally robbed at the Oscars and a rare example of children who can actually act. Willem Dafoe is also as amazing as always."
6, "Possibly the best movie of 2017. The only contender being Blade Runner 2049which didn't have characters anywhere near as complex or interesting as this."
6, "Just outside of the Happiest Place on Earthdisplaced trailer trash Halley just barely scrapes by living in a hotel and renting her body out to strangers while her daughter roams the streetsblissfully unaware of just how bad her situation is. If you've ever worked in retail or customer service or with the public in any fashionthen Halley's """Whateveryou don't know me!""" attitude will no doubt ring familiar. Worth watching for a heartbreaking performance by the kids and an atypically un-evil Willem Dafoe."
6, "O longa não cai em armadilhas pedantes do cinema independentehá um equilíbrio entre a direção (inventivasem exageros) e a condução da história. Tudo beneficiado pelo ótimo elenco. Inexplicável ausência na lista de melhores longas da última edição do Oscar."
6, "Bomboş filmbomboş. Amerikalıların vatana millete nasıl zararlı olduğunu gösteren bir yapım adeta. Başroldeki ablamız da güzel ama sesi itici. Ayrıca gösteriyor ki çocukları biraz da döverek büyütmek lazım"
7, "not as many neon lights. sad."
7, "Had nooo idea if who played John Wick wasn't Keanu Reeves."
7, "It's not as cool or as surprising as the originaland the main villain is weaker. But it doesn't disappoint eithergiving us some great choreography to chew on. The stand-out performance is from Commonwho has the kind of intenseunbroken stare that makes him a greatconvincing heavy."
7, "Keanu Reeves going rampantbecause why not?!"
7, "It forgets the part that could have really mattered-- John Wick not willing to go back to his old part--but for action-thriller moviesthe fights are quite good."
7, "this movie: - invented neon light; - made me attracted to keanu reeves"
7, "Watched it again the king of action movies i love it and waiting like crazies to the third one that would be incredible too Keanu is perfect as john wick he is awesome ."
7, "All about them fights but the star of the show is the world they’ve built.; It was hinted and teased in the first film but the secret society of assassins they reveal in this film is so well done.; I was worried that after the simple story of the first film this would feel like an unnecessary sequel but the plot unfolds really well. But yeah sick fights wooooooooo!"
7, "Mostly just nice to see both this and Pitch Perfect in 4K UHD. Neither had much in the way of detail that I hadn't seen beforebut the HDR color added plenty to both."
7, "Also..."
8, "Heckin whacky"
8, "About as magical as movies can get. I forgot just how great this was. I still like Coraline better though. Lowkey """What Have I Done""" might be a Marilyn Manson song at its core"
8, "A film that could easily coast on its richly imaginative gothic visuals'Nightmare Before Christmas' surprisingly manages to also provide a story that's ingeniously simplistic and yet surprisingly insightful. While the stop-motion has dated a littleits still a wonderfully straightforward visual feast for the eyes and the ears and its not hard to see why the movie continues to endure in people's imagination."
8, "greatest cultural appropriation metaphor of all time"
8, "Great and strange movie. Love the characters LockShockand Barreland the Oogie Boogie."
8, "Watched it on acid in a movie theater. 4/5 stars"
8, "Unglaublichwie aufwendig Nightmare Before Christmas gemacht wurde. Allein schon dafür hat er eine gute Wertung verdient. Eigentlich mag ich Tim Burtons Filme ja nicht wirklichaber dieser hier ist derartig aufwendig und kreativ gemachtdass ich viel Spaß beim anschauen hatte. Die Atmosphäre ist wunderbar und ich kann verstehenwieso ihn viele als Klassiker ansehen."
8, "i hate to say it out loudbut i'm kin with that folk that called jack skellington """bone daddy.""""
8, "Utilizing stop motion technologyThe Nightmare Before Christmas is visually stunningfrom the design of the cemetery to Oogie Boogie. The film features great music from Danny Elfman."
8, "4 stars for beautiful animation+1 because my husband used to have a crush on jack skellington-2 because my grown ass loser ass former best friend never shuts up about it."
9, "Disturbingyet thought-provoking with a phenomenal score: quite surprising."
9, "Look. This is a despicable film about despicable people who do despicable things. And it's incredibly hard to watch."
9, "But it's directed by Stanley Kubrickso obviously as a FILMit's incredible."
9, "4 3/4 out of 5 stars - I simply do not think it's quite up there with Kubrick's absolute bestbut who knows...maybe I'm wrong"
9, "80/100"
9, "Unparalleled"
9, "what too heck is going on in here on this very day"
9, "4.75/5"
9, "From the opening orange screen I was completely hooked.... fo some reason."
9, "This is very disturbing and uncomfortable to watchbut I recognize the craft."
9, "Ein Film der die Zeit überlebt."
9, "Every great story starts with a glass of milk."
9, " Ps: the first time I watched it Was with my brotherand I was 12. As for nowI grew up to be a normal healthy non-psychopatic kid 😃"
9, "Singing in the Rain will never be the same"
9, "I can still confidently say that eggy weggs are superior to steaky wakes."
9, "last time i watched this (in middle school) it was the best thing i'd ever seenand blew my mind. this time around the movie just made me sick."
10, "i was high and barely paid attention i need to rewatch this lol"
10, "Probably the funniest Coen Brothers’ comedy I’ve seen so far. Watching these reprehensible morons descend into violence and paranoia is an absolute delight."
10, "Malkovich and Pitt are standoutsbut that's it?"
10, "chaotic &amp; hilarious &amp; stellar cast"
10, "A loving ode to chaos"
10, "I fell asleep halfway through but I liked the parts I saw."
10, "Pretty standard stuff from the Coen brothersthe multiple plot lines would sometimes feel tough to followbut then J.K. Simmons' character would just tell us what had happened."
10, "Streaming. Netflix."
10, "John Malkovich and Brad Pitt were definitely the highlights. Really missed the Deakins-Coen's collaboration here as they work so well together but the cinematography is still really well done nonetheless. Overallit's a super funny film with very memorable moments and characters that has the Coen brothers written all over it."
10, "uh ok i think i liked it"
10, "Chad Pitt deserved so much better"
11, "اول مرة اعيط من كتر الضحك والبهجة والجمال كسم جمال دا فيلم على كسم جمال كل واحد موجود فيه"
11, "79"
11, "I finally watched Little Miss Sunshine."
11, "It's a very good road trip movie with many funnybut also emotional scenes and good actors."
11, " By the way I REALLY need some people with which I can chat about movies or something in my boring spare time."
11, "So write me on Instagram."
11, "My name on Instagram: 2.0_._0.3"
11, "( Write me that you're from Letterboxd first that I know you are a LB user )"
11, "The family in this film have all of my heart and that's never gonna change. Every time I finish watching this I happy cry and you bet this viewing carried that streak on."
11, "SO SWEET. Forgot about all that bittersweet tenderness. You goyou brokenill-fitted family ♥"
11, "This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth."
11, "Olive is a fucking angel she deserves the world"
11, "Fuck eveyone elsewe got grandpa in the trunk bitches."
11, "the final scenedwayne’s meltdownthe LOVE radiating from this film...perfection!"
11, "Second (or third?) time watching it.;"
11, "A classic. Abigail Breslin is a star.;"
11, """"And where is he now?""" """In the trunk of our car.""""
11, "There's something so beautiful about the mess that is this family. Wowso good."
11, "“you do what you loveand fuck the rest.”"
12, "What a story"
12, "cried so much :’)"
12, "A beautifulimaginative and pure tribute to the art of story tellingbrilliantly illustrating the way stories define us as human beings."
12, "top 5 for sure"
12, "This is one of those that Zi want very much to like &amp; because it involves Albert FinneyI do. ; Butit just doesn’t quite get across the finish line..."
12, "BE THE HERO OF YOUR STORY IF YOU CAAAANN BE THE CHAMPION IN THE FIGHT NOT JUST THE MAAANN DONT DEPEND ON OTHER PEOPLE TO PUT PAPER NEXT TO PEN BE THE HERO OF YOUR STORY BOY AND THEN YOU CAN RISE TO BE THE HERO ONCE AGAIN"
12, "This was calming and nice."
12, "felt like so much happened but none of it really interested me that much until the last third"
12, "I’m still shock about the end"
12, "It’s really sadI really like the ending of this film and think it’s extremely hard hittingbut the rest of it was thoroughly annoying. I’m left thinkingwas it necessary for the film to have this overly ecstatic 2nd act for the ending to be this good? Should the film be hindered by its necessary sacrifices for the greater final act? Isn’t this just like the most natural compensation between moments of intense and calm?"
12, "How can a fucking Tim Burton movie leave me so quarreled"
13, "Loopers: Assassinos do Futuro"
13, "As excellent as when I saw it over 6 years ago. The storysymbolismand camera work is top notch sci-fi. Rain Johnson has a way of telling stories and this kept me on edge of my seat even on the second viewing! I still also LOVE the ending!"
13, "This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth."
13, "This entire movie could be fixed with one throwaway line about parallel timelines"
13, "I love time travel films."
13, "Looper is a film made by a true time-travel fan. Rian Johnson takes a concept that has been presented on film for decades and expands on it in new and exciting ways. The torturous death of a character in this film was the epitome of taking advantage of the concept of time traveland this film takes that entire concept to another level."
13, "I love Looper."
13, "Forgot a lot of the third actso this was quite enjoyable for my third watch. I love a lot that this movie doesespecially a groundedno-nonsense view of time travel and the future. I hope Rian comes back to original work at some point."
13, "i love u Rian Johnson"
13, "Clever premisecool styleand I really dig JGL playing young Willis. I wasn’t bothered by any paradox bullshit but I’m also stupid and don’t pick up on those things so I dunno. Also I didn’t know Emily Blunt was in this? Even though I’ve seen it before?!?"
13, "If anythingthis film just demonstrates Johnson’s willingness to make bold moveswhich I think everyone saw paid off in his future endeavors."
13, "I think I've seen too much time travel stuff. This was really good though."
13, "A movie about finding yourself :’)"
13, "Always a pleasure to watch. The visualsthe scriptthe leadsall great."
14, "What really sells this movie is how effortless it feels. You slip into these storiesand forget you are watching a film."
14, "One of Tom Hanks best performances."
14, "Real famjust real."
14, """"Oh my God I trust in theelet me not be ashamedlet not my enemies try and fool me.""""
14, "البِداية من حيثُ النهاية، وآلام الحرب التي لا تُفنى يُصورها لكم الفِلم في ساعتين وخمسين دقيقة."
14, "Watch this movie and then try to complain about how difficult your life is"
14, "8.5/10"
14, "How did Vin Diesel go from this to fast and furious?"
14, "One of Spielberg’s best and has maybe the greatest and second greatest battle sequences In film history. Can quote every line and love how Spielberg uses the camera. A lot to like here."
14, "One of the best war movies I have ever seenfull on gore that shows the real horror of war. Intensifying all the way through and is why I always rewatch it."
14, "My sister hated main actor in this movie."
15, "Learn to be happy right now. Otherwiseyou'll run out of time."
15, "عندما تبحث عن السعادة لابد ان تتعلم أولا كيف تكون سعيد في نفس اللحظة الي تمتلكها بعيدا عن الظروف والمعوقات يمكنك ان تعيش بسعادة مع ما تملك اذا كنت فقط تملك اللحظة التي بين يديك"
15, "فيلم رائع جدا وبلمس القلب &lt;3"
15, "I don’t know why we watched this in my Spanish class but I’m not complaining! Beautiful friendship between Philippe and Drisswith a story that realistically examines disability without pitying or over-dramatizing it’s characters."
15, "2 oder 3 mal in der Schule gesehen. Nicht schlecht."
15, "المخرج بخل علينا والله انه خلى الفيلم ساعتين بس"
15, "Beautiful"
15, "I should really watch this film again because I was baked and although I remember quite clearly how it made me feelI think that it deserves better. Really beautifulhonest and emotive filmmaking."
15, "This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth."
15, "As far as feel-good crowd pleasing movies gothis one is really good. Definitely a movie I could show to my family."
15, " Howeverthe sexual harassment subplot has NOT aged well. It’s a shame to have such an uncomfortable and poorly handled set of gags in an otherwise largely unproblematic film."
15, "Es demasiado bonita."
15, "Omar Sy was greatbut a bit of a sexual harasser."
15, "Best use of Earthwind and fire I've ever seen in a French film."
15, "BASED ON A TRUE STORY. holy shit. that twist. who would have thought thatIN REAL LIFEable bodied people can be friends with disabled people? poor people can be friends with rich people? white people can be friends with black people???*"
15, " *actually they cant i guessthe carer was an arab in real life. but stillWOW."
16, "Decent cult comedyI enjoyed the light takes on many of the common vampire tropeswithout falling fully into parody."
16, "Not the funniest movie I've ever seenbut definitely not too bad either."
16, "This movie is a giant heart and clever wrapped in the perfect big dumb package."
16, "Whenever I finish this movie I usually think to myselfwhat if I just watched it again right now. Do I really have anything I need to do today?;"
16, "And rememberwe are werewolvesnot swear wolves."
16, "what are we? werewolves not swearwolves"
16, "We’re not swear wolves we’re werewolves"
16, "This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth."
16, "taika waititi and jemaine clement invented comedy. change my mind"
16, "Very creative. Glad that the vampire joke never wore out. Those werewolves tho."
16, "This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth."
16, "My favorite ❤️"
16, "جميل البتاع دا"
16, "i needed this so much n i loved how they used different vampire myths tbh. Also the main vampire is lowkey a soft version of Mr.Darcy"
17, "8/10"
17, "Anton"
17, "I remember being so hypped for this movie around its release datebut for 5 years I never watched it and I really dont know why... now I feel this could have save my teen years"
17, "🌹"
17, "Largely plotless but has an atmosphere so thick and beautiful and mesmerising that it's hard to care."
17, "This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth."
17, "Was this supposed to be two hours of nothing? Because I was bored as hell watching this."
17, "Jim Jarmusch tem um efeito em seus filmes que me faz sempre querer morar nelesuma linda metáfora sobre o amormeu filme preferido de vampiros."
17, "Espero um dia entender todas as referencias intelectuais do casal e não só conhecer o Jack White hahaha"
17, """"I think the world has enough chaos to keep it going for the minute.""""
17, "I just can't get enough of the way Mr. Jarmusch looks at the world... I'd very much like to believe his version of it all."
17, "Gente misericórdiaeu levei quatroQUATRO fucking days pra terminar esse filmepor pura insistência pq não gosto de ver filme pela metade. Tilda Swinton está maravilhosa nesse filme mas nem isso conseguiu me segurar para ver ele sem interromper. Enfim eu sei que a proposta do filme é ser mais monótono mesmo mas ainda assim tem filmes nesse mesmo estilo bem melhores que esse"
17, "Immortal lovers interested in musicarts and science played by Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston. They also love Jack White. What else could you ask for? Brilliant acting and great metaphors about the dying culture of our world."
18, "64/100"
18, "Great!"
18, "Batman is one of the best Batman films. Jack Nicholson is fantastic as the Joker/Jack Napier and Michael Keaton is terrific as the Dark Knight. The set designs are amazingas is the score by Danny Elfman. One of the best comic book films."
18, "Visually outdated sometimes (in terms of propseffects and stunts) but generally stands the test of time."
18, "Jack Nicholson (and everyone elsereally) is too much of a character for me but I guess it works well with the whole movie being a little more exaggerated than reality (and considering the fact that it's a Tim Burton film)."
18, "A good movie overallespecially for one that is almost thirty years old."
18, "Watched for Music in Film class."
18, """"He don't look happyhe's been using Brand X.""""
18, "Still so much fun and I absolutely love the way Gotham looks in thisit fits so well with the Burton aesthetic. Nicholson still terrific."
18, "Keaton is the best Batman"
18, "This was one of my favourites when I was a little kidand I can still respect it on a technical levelespecially for its time. But...there are problems. Numerous problemsmade all the more glaring by Nolan's 'Begins' -- a demonstration on how this should be done. Shot during a writer strikeBurton had free reign to make creative changes to the mythoswhich results in some mind-bogglingly stupid bitsand a film that's more Jack being Jack than actual Batman. Alsothe Prince songs suck."
18, "Since this is one of Burton’s more restrained moviesit actually makes total sense that the most Burton thing about this is the overbuilt noir-style Gotham. With all the buildings seemingly growing out of each other and the floods of gray and blackit makes sense that this city would be responsible for a guy who dresses up like a giant bat fighting an insane crime boss with an affinity for clowns"
18, "I’ll take Burton’s take over Nolan’sbut even for a superhero movie this has a hard on for the damsel in distress."
18, "Direction: 1 Writing/Story: 0 Performances: 1 (for Nicholson) Enjoyability: 2 Notability: 0"
18, "uhhh theres some good industrial gothic"
18, "We  like history in this movie.I  contempt main actor in this movie."
